Sentiment Analysis of Online Food Orders
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and sentiment analysis on a dataset containing online food order details. The primary goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in the feedback—whether it is positive or negative—and to uncover insights into customer preferences and satisfaction levels.

Methodology
The analysis involves several key steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing duplicate records to ensure data quality.
Data Visualization: Employing histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots to visualize demographic information and ordering trends.
Sentiment Analysis: Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and predict sentiment from customer feedback.
Data Description
The dataset, Onlinefooddata.csv, includes various features such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, monthly income, and educational qualifications of customers, along with their feedback on the food orders.

Results and Insights
Demographic Analysis: Revealed a significant engagement from young adults, particularly those around the age of 24, which indicates the platform's popularity among college students and early career professionals.
Income Analysis: Identified income trends and their correlation with age, highlighting potential market segments for targeted advertising and special offers.
Sentiment Distribution: The sentiment analysis highlighted a predominant positive feedback trend with some areas for improvement in addressing negative feedback effectively.
Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: For data organization and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
NLTK: For processing and analyzing text data.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
